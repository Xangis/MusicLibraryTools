The Song Length Finder is a quick and easy tool to find songs of a specific
playing time.  It is meant to be used by those looking building song
compilations, soundtracks, musical interludes, or any situation that
requires a song of a specific length.

It automatically traverses subdirectories and will index any files it finds.

After indexing, you can easily search for and match songs of a specific length
or range of lengths.

The .NET Framework 3.5 is required.  You probably already have it installed.

The Song Length Finder was built using the TagLib# library.
