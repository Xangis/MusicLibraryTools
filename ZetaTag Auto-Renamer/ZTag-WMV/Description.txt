The ZetaTag Auto-Renamer is a quick and easy tool to rename music files into a
format that is easily recognized by Humans.  It uses tag information to
automatically rename all MP3, WMA, and OGG music files to the following format:

Artist - Album - Track Number - Track Name.ext

It automatically traverses subdirectories and will rename any files it finds.

Files without a full set of information for artist, album, track number, and
track name will not be renamed.

This application does not allow configuration beyond the separator character
(some people like to use underscores because they are more internet-friendly).
It does only one thing and it does it well.

This program was created for the purpose of maintaining our music collection,
but it is provided for free here in case it will be useful to others.

The .NET Framework 3.5 is required.  You probably already have it installed.

The ZetaTag Auto-Renamer was built using the TagLib# library.
